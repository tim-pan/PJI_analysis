# PJI_analysis
These are the projects in Data Mining course.
## introduction
There are two projects in this repository\
\
**For Project1**</br>
Professor asked us to use the [1] by J. Quinlan to be the classifier in project1.\
The goal of project1 is to do data preprocessing and use c45 source code to classifiy the datapoints\
In this project, since source code of [1] is extremely old, you need to modify the source code to fit your os and complier\
For example, change "cfree" to "free"\
Or change "exit" to "exit(1)", and so on.
\
**For Project2**\
Professor asked us to tried kinds of classifiers and datasets to decide which combination is the best for classification\
Do a comprehensive survey on different combinations.\
