# PJI_analysis
These are the projects in Data Mining course in NYCU.
## introduction
There are two projects in this repository</br>
#### **For Project1**</br>
Professor asked us to use the [1] by J. Quinlan to be the classifier in project1.</br>
The goal of project1 is to do data preprocessing and use c45 source code to classifiy the datapoints</br>
In this project, since source code of [1] is extremely old, </br>
you need to modify the source code to fit your os and complier</br>
For example, change "cfree" to "free"</br>
Or change "exit" to "exit(1)", and so on.</br>
#### **For Project2**
Professor asked us to tried kinds of classifiers and datasets to decide which combination is the best for classification</br>
Do a comprehensive survey on different combinations.</br>
</br>
pdf files above are the introduction of corresponding project.
